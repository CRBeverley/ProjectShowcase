<!--
    This Web page can be hand-coded using an HTML editor, or you can use a website builder for this assignment. 
    This site will serve as your Project Showcase page and will provide links to select assignments. 
    The project showcase page should have a section for assigned case problems and the course project included in the design. 
    You will add the following components - an introduction, and pages 
    (About Me, Certifications, Workshops, Awards, Professional Memberships, Projects: Cases 1 – 3,
    and review assignment 1), and a disclaimer that states,
    “this website is for a Web Technologies class and no products or services are available for purchase”
    in the border of each published page. You will use the information in the 
    *pdf below to create your Project Showcase Page which will serve as your e-Portfolio and the 
    start of your professional online presence.  It is hoped that you will continue collecting 
    artifacts to add to your e-Portfolio throughout your academic and professional career.
