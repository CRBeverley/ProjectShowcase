You have been hired to design and develop a website for a local business. Your customer has looked at websites such as Panera Bread (Links to an external site.) and Crispy’s (Links to an external site.) and wants something similar.

constraints:
Your project will consist of the following:

HTML 5
Web graphics,
tables,
forms,
CSS,
video,
audio, and
JavaScript.
The site will be no more than 4-6 pages
and should be based on a fictitious entity.
Now that you have a creative brief, a storyboard, and some pages created, it's time to put them together and test the results with your friends, family, and fellow classmates. Do they think your product looks like a website for an actual business? Take their feedback and modify accordingly; they can be your best source of web proofing.
